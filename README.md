# Operators-in-CPP
AIM:
To study and implement various operators in C++.

OBJECTIVE:
Understand and demonstrate the use of different types of operators available in the C++ programming language, including:

Arithmetic Operators

Relational Operators

Logical Operators

Assignment Operators

Increment/Decrement Operators

Bitwise Operators

Conditional (Ternary) Operator

Special Operators (e.g., sizeof, comma)

TOOLS REQUIRED:
C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC or Turbo C++)

IDE (e.g., Code::Blocks, Visual Studio Code, Dev C++)

THEORY:
Operators in C++ are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. C++ supports a rich set of built-in operators.

Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %

Relational Operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=

Logical Operators: &&, ||, !

Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=

Increment/Decrement Operators: ++, --

Bitwise Operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>

Conditional (Ternary) Operator: condition ? expr1 : expr2

Special Operators: sizeof, , (comma), :: (scope resolution)
